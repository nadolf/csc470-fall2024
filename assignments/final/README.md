# Final Design Document
### Gameplay description
This game will be a third-person point-of-view (POV) adventure game where the player navigates a vibrant environment to collect items. The primary goal is to maintain energy levels, which deplete over time and affect the player's movement speed. To recover energy, the player must collect specific items within a set time limit. Failure to refuel in time results in game over. The player may also encounter treasure hunt elements, requiring the collection of specific items in sequence to achieve bonus objectives.

### Input
So this will be a typical third player game where you would use the up button to move forward, down to go back words, and left and right to move in those directions. They will also have the ability to jump.

### Visual Style
For the the aestic of the game I would like it to be fun with bright colors, also with characters from the same theme, maybe like spongebob theme where all the characters are fromt he biniki bottom. 

### Audio style
For audio I would like the that character make sounds for jumping animations if possible and and collecting items. And also have background music throughout thegame.

### Interface Sketches
**Start Menu:**

Title of the game.
A "Start Game" button.

**In-Game HUD:**

Energy Bar: A visual tracker for the player’s energy level, prominently displayed.

Timer: Countdown for the next energy refill requirement.

Item Counter: Displays the number of items collected.

**Game Over/Win Screen:**
Options to retry or return to the main menu.

### Story/theme description
The game’s story is light and playful. The main character, an energetic sea creature, is on a quest to collect energy sources (e.g., kelp shakes, shiny treasures) scattered across the ocean floor. Their energy depletes as they explore, and they must continuously refuel to maintain their speed and avoid running out of time. Bonus objectives, like collecting rare treasures in sequence, add an extra challenge.

Backup Theme: If the SpongeBob inspiration isn't feasible, the game will shift to a generic underwater explorer theme with the same mechanics.
